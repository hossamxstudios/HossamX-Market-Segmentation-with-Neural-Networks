# HossamX-Market-Segmentation-with-Neural-Networks

## Project Overview
This project involves a comprehensive approach to data analysis and machine learning, utilizing Python's powerful libraries. We focus on data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, visualization, and predictive modeling using deep learning techniques.

## Installation
To run this project, you will need the following libraries:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- TensorFlow
- Keras

You can install these packages using pip:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn tensorflow keras
```

## Data
The project uses a dataset named `bnk.csv`. It includes various features (both categorical and numerical) essential for the predictive modeling task.

## Usage
1. Data Preprocessing: The project includes extensive data cleaning steps, such as handling missing values, unknown values, and outliers.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis: Statistical summaries and visualizations help understand the dataset.
3. Machine Learning: We build and train a deep learning model using TensorFlow and Keras for prediction purposes.

## Structure
The project is structured as follows:
1. **Data Loading and Initial Exploration**
2. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
4. **Feature Engineering and Data Encoding**
5. **Model Building and Evaluation**

## Results
The deep learning model showed promising results in predictive accuracy. Further tuning and validation are required for production deployment.
